\title{Andrei's blog}
\section{20 March 2022}
Today I've created my new blog. It supports only static html, but
we'll see if it needs more features in future.
\par
If it works, this line is on a new paragraph. It should also support
Cyrillic symbols and Russian words, such as Большой or маленький.
Also, it uses some pseudo-LaTeX features, such as \it{italic} font. And,
there is an look-up table with Greek symbols, so here we go:
\Alpha \Beta \Gamma \Delta \epsilon \Epsilon, \omicron and \Omicron.
\par
Let's also check quotation marks,
such as ``ж`` or ``щ``, and dashes:
M dash --- , N dash -- and hyphen -).
\subsection{Subsection 2}
This is subsection 2.
